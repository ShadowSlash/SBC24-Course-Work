            <h3>First Website</h3>
            <p>One of my earliest projects was creating and designing a website for my uncle's eco-friendly business. He and his partner run an organization focused on providing sustainable solutions to modern challenges. During my travels to the Algarve region in southern Portugal, I stayed in an eco-hut they built, fully immersed in the serene, mountainous landscape. The tranquility of the surroundings gave me the space to reconnect with my passion for coding and technology. After discussing how I could contribute to their mission, we decided I would design a website to showcase their remarkable work.

            <h3>First Terraform</h3>
            <p>One of the most rewarding projects I’ve been a part of was helping terraform a mountainside and build two eco-houses, along with a ferrocement cistern. Together, we worked on shaping the land to support sustainable living spaces. The ferrocement cistern we built—a durable water storage solution made by layering mortar over a steel framework—was essential for collecting and storing rainwater in this off-grid setting. The hands-on experience of working with natural materials, combined with the breathtaking environment, deepened my appreciation for sustainable construction and solidified my passion for eco-conscious design.</p>
